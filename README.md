# FIREBIRD-II_POES_electron-precip


This repository contains the code used to estimate FIREBIRD count equivalents 
based on POES/MetOP MEPED instruments. 

Sample code is for a conjunction between FIRBIRD-II FU3 and MetOP2a on 2018-12-31.

## Description

This study compares energetic electron precipitation measurements
by the Focused Investigations of Relativistic Electron Burst Intensity
Range, and Dynamics (FIREBIRD-II) CubeSats with NOAA Polar-orbiting
Operational Environmental Satellite (POES) and ESA Meteorological 
Operational satellite (MetOp) satellites, which are equipped with the
Medium-Energy Proton Electron Detector (MEPED).

FIREBIRD-II CubeSats and POES/MetOp Satellites from 2018-2020"
